# computerVision

This is all the labs and projects I worked on for Computer Vision in Korea.

Project 1 - Canny edge detection. Lots of it is commented out as there is no single best approach to it so toying around with different functions can give you thinner lines, thicker lines, etc. This edge detection takes in any image and gives a black and white image of the edges of an image.

Project 2 - Image stitching. Given two or more images, will find keypoints within each image and match. Once matched, transformation of keypoints' surrounding corners are taken into account and image is transformed to match with the angles of the image if image was taken from a different angle.

hw1 - Numpy basics and image color-channel suppression.

hw2 - Image manipulation and transformation. Scaling, Translation, and Rotation.

hw3 - Facial recognition using PCA including several approaches. Original algorithm, using a mathematical linear algebra trick, and SVD.

hw4 - Histogram equalization and filters.

hw5 - Sobel edge detection, nothing in folder. This lab was canceled. Sobel edge detection is found in the following homework as the basis for Canny edge detection project [Project 1].

hw6 - Hough Transform. Uninteresting on it's own, useful for other algorithms.

hw7 - Harris corner detection.

hw8 - SIFT feature matching, uses RANSAC but bruteforce and FLANN algorithms are also possible.
